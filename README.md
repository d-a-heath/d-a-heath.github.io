I am currently a PhD student at the University of Memphis working in the [Language and Behavior Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/stephaniehuette/people) with Dr. Stephanie Huette. Previously, I worked for the [Langauge Conservancy](https://languageconservancy.org/) and the Crow Language Consortium as a linguist on several langauge revitalization projects. I hold an MA in Linguistics from the University of Montana.
