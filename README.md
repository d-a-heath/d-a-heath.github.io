I am currently a PhD student in Experimental Psychology (Cognitive Area) at the University of Memphis working in the [Language and Behavior Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/stephaniehuette/people) with Dr. Stephanie Huette. Previously, I worked for the [Langauge Conservancy](https://languageconservancy.org/) and the Crow Language Consortium as a linguist on several langauge revitalization projects. I hold an MA in Linguistics from the University of Montana. 

Some areas of interest include:
  - abstraction & metaphor
  - categorization & category learning
  - direct (social) perception
  - interpersonal coordination
  - language ideologies & bias
  - modality (in both relevant senses)
  - negation
  - perceptual (language) learning
