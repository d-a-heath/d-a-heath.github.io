# WOR(L)DS

We enter into a preformed social world, and through our social performance we restructure that world. The social world makes us, we make the social world. 

Language is, for humans at least, a foundational component of this dialogic self-formation. Langauage is how we form corporations, colleges, and co-ops. We build communities through cooperative action, coordinated in no small part by linguistic practice. Language also reflect the cognitive constraints & mechanisms that define what we are as thinking beings. The core of my research program is exploring the ways that language comprehension & use reflect this intersection of the cognitive and social worlds.

I am currently a PhD student in Experimental Psychology (Cognitive Area) at the University of Memphis working in the [Language and Behavior Lab](https://sites.google.com/site/stephaniehuette/people) with Dr. Stephanie Huette. Previously, I worked for the [Langauge Conservancy](https://languageconservancy.org/) and the Crow Language Consortium as a linguist on several langauge revitalization projects. I hold a MA in Linguistics from the University of Montana.
