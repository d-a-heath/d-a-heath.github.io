# Research

We enter into a preformed social environment, and through our social performance we restructure that environment. The social makes us, we make the social. 

Language is, for humans at least, a foundational component of this dialogic self-formation. Langauage is how we form corporations, colleges, and co-ops. We build communities & relationships through cooperative action, coordinated in no small part by linguistic practice. Language is also necessarily shaped by the cognitive constraints & mechanisms that define what and who we are as thinking beings. The core of my research program is exploring the ways that language reflects this intersection of the cognitive and social.

##   Ongoing Projects:

###  Social constraints on interpersonal coordination.

###  How (not) to use RQA

###  How does interaction modality informs user trust in GenAI systems? 

###  How modals interact with pragmatic inferences.

### Preposition learning under variable input distributions.
