# Research

We enter into a preformed social world, and through our social performance we restructure that world. The social world makes us, we make the social world. 

Language is, for humans at least, a foundational component of this dialogic self-formation. Langauage is how we form corporations, colleges, and co-ops. We build communities through cooperative action, coordinated in no small part by linguistic practice. Language also reflect the cognitive constraints & mechanisms that define what we are as thinking beings. The core of my research program is exploring the ways that language comprehension & use reflect this intersection of the cognitive and social worlds.

##   Ongoing Projects:

###  Social constraints on interpersonal coordination

###  How (not) to use RQA

###  How modals interact with pragmatic inferences
